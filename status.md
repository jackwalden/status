#### What have you done for your project so far?

I started coding the program and have a working version of the game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I definitely need to refine the code so that the visual output looks much nicer and is more interactive, as well as more similar to the actual Wordle game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No major problems so far
